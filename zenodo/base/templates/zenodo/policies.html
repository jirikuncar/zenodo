    <h4>Content</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Scope</dt>
<dd>All fields of science. All types of research artifacts. Content must not violate privacy or copyright, or breach confidentiality or non-disclosure for data collected from human subjects.</dd>

<dt>Status of research data</dt>
<dd>Any status is accepted, from any stage of the research lifecycle.</dd>

<dt>Eligible depositors</dt>
<dd>Anyone may register as user of {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}. All users are allowed to deposit content for which they possess the appropriate rights.</dd>

<dt>Ownership</dt>
<dd>By uploading content, no change of ownership is implied, and no property rights are transfer to CERN. All uploaded content remains the property of the parties prior to submission.</dd>

<dt>Versions</dt>
<dd>Data files are versioned. Records are not versioned. The uploaded data is archived as a Submission Information Package. Derivatives of data files are generated, but original content is never modified.
Records can be retracted from public view, however the data files and record is preserved.</dd>

<dt>Data file formats</dt>
<dd>All formats are allowed - even preservation unfriendly. We are working on guidelines and features that will help people deposit in preservation friendly formats.</dd>

<dt>Volume and size limitations</dt>
<dd>2GB per file size constraint. Higher quotas per file can be requested. Quotas are likely to be introduced at a later stage. All data files are stored in CERN Data Centres, primarily Geneva, with replicas in Budapest. Data files are kept in multiple replicas in a distributed file system which is backed up to tape on a nightly basis.</dd>

<dt>Data quality</dt>
<dd>All information is provided “as-is” and the user shall hold ZENODO and information providers supplying data to ZENODO free and harmless in connection with the use of such information.</dd>

</dl>

<h4>Withdrawal of data and revocation of DOIs</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Revocation</dt>
<dd>Content not considered to fall under the scope of the repository will be removed and associated DOIs issued by {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} revoked. Please signal promptly any suspected policy violation, ideally no later than 24 hours from upload. Alternatively, content found to already have an external DOI, will have the {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} DOI invalidated, and the record updated to indicate the original external DOI. User access may be revoked on violation of Terms of Use.</dd>

<dt>Withdrawal</dt>
<dd>If the uploaded research object must later be withdrawn, the reason for the withdrawal will be indicated on a tombstone page which will henceforth be served in its place. Withdrawal is considered an exceptional action which normally should be requested and fully justified by the original uploader. In any other circumstance reasonable attempts will be made to contact the original uploader to obtain consent. The DOI and the URL of the original object are retained.</dd>
