    <li>
        <h5>What is the maximum file size I can upload?</h5>
        <p>We currently accept files up to 2GB. If you would like to upload larger files, please <a href="{{url_for('zenodo_base.contact')}}">contact us</a>, and we will do our best to help you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What are the size limits in {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}?</h5>
        <p>Currently there's a per file size limit of 2GB (you can have several 2GB files per dataset) and no limit on communities. Since we target the long-tail of science, we want this slice to be always free. We don’t want to turn away larger use cases either, but naturally we cant offer infinite space for free (!) so there must be a ceiling to this free slice, above which we will introduce paid for slices according to the business model developed within the sustainability plan. N.b. The current infrastructure has been tested with 10GB files, so possibly we can also raise the file limit either per community or for the whole of {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} if needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What can I upload?</h5>
        <p>All research outputs from all fields of science are welcome. In the upload form you can choose between types of files: publications (book, book section, conference paper, journal article, patent, preprint, report, thesis, technical note, working paper), posters, presentations, images (figures, plots, drawings, diagrams, photos) and videos/audio. We do check every piece of content being uploaded to ensure it is research related. Please see further information in our <a href="{{url_for('zenodo_base.terms')}}">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="{{url_for('zenodo_base.policies')}}">Policies</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Is {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} only for EU-funded research?</h5>
        <p>No. We are open to all research outputs from all fields of science regardless of funding source. Given that {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} was launched within an EU funded project, the knowledge bases were first filled with EU project codes, but we are keen to extend this to other funders with your help.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>How do you plan to secure ongoing funding for {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is still in its infancy, so whilst this is a good question to ask, we don’t have just one definitive answer since we are exploring several avenues as we mature the services. {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} was launched within the <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIREplus</a> project as part of a European-wide research infrastructure. OpenAIREplus will deliver a sustainability plan for this infrastructure, with the optic of services for the future Horizon 2020 projects, and so this is definitely one possible funding source. Another possibility is CERN itself - {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is developed and hosted by CERN in synergy with other large services running on the same software such as <a href="http://cds.cern.ch">CERN Document Server</a> and <a href="http://inspirehep.net">INSPIRE-HEP</a>. And CERN is familiar with large research datasets, managing the Large Hadron Collier data archive of 100 petabytes. Lastly {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is developed on a fully open platform and, if found beneficial in a sustainability plan, could be migrated to a third party entity outside CERN. No matter which direction {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} will take, we are fully dedicated to delivering an open service and preserving your research for the future.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Is my data safe with you / What will happen to my uploads in the unlikely event that {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} has to close?</h5>
        <p>Yes, your data is stored in CERN Data Centre. Both data files and metadata is kept in multiple online replicas, as well as backed up to tape every night. CERN has considerable knowledge and experience in building and operating large scale digital repositories. In the highly unlikely event that {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} will have to close operations, we guarantee that we will migrate all content to other suitable repositories, and since all uploads have DOIs all citations and links to the dataset will not be affected.

    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What does it cost / Can we pay for ZENODO services? </h5>
        <p>ZENODO is free for the long tail of Science. In order to offer services to the more resource hungry research, we will introduce a ceiling to the free slice and offer paid for slices above, according to the business model developed within the sustainability plan. If you can't wait but immediately want to explore these paid for options, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and we will look at interim measures with you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Really, who pays for this?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is developed by <a href="http://www.cern.ch">CERN</a> under the EU FP7 project <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIREplus</a> (grant agreement no. 283595).</p>

        <h5>Why is my upload not on the front-page?</h5>
        <p>All uploads go through a quick spam check by our staff prior to going on the front-page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Why is my closed access upload not on the front-page?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is a strong supporter of open data in all its forms (meaning data that anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute), and takes an incentives approach to encourage deposition under an open licence. We therefore only display Open Access uploads on the front-page. Your Closed Access upload is still discoverable through search queries, its DOI and community collections where it is included.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Why do you allow closed access uploads?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is a strong supporter of open data in all its forms (meaning data that anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute), and takes an incentives approach to encourage deposition under an open licence. Since there isn't a unique way of licensing openly, and no consensus on the practice of adding attribution restrictions, we accept data under a variety of licences in order to be inclusive. We will however take an active lead in signalling the extra benefits of the most open licences, in terms of visibility and credit, and offer additional services and upload quotas on such data to encourage using them. This follows naturally from the publications policy of the <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIRE initiative</a> which has been supporting Open Access throughout, but since it aims to gather all European Commission/European Research Area research results, it allows submission of the material which is not yet Open Access.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What happened to the OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository?</h5>
        <p>OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository got a make-over and was re-branded as {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}. If you happened to deposit your article in OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository it is also available in {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}. You user account, was however not transferred to {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}, so you will have to <a href="{{url_for('youraccount.register')}}">register</a> again. If you register with the same email address in {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} as you used in OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository, you will still have access to your publications. Don't hesitate to <a href="{{url_for('zenodo_base.contact')}}">contact us</a> for further information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Where does the name come from?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodotus">Zenodotus</a>, the first librarian of the Ancient Library of Alexandria and father of the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>How much storage do CERN have available?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is currently a drop in the ocean. CERN currently stores more than 100PB of physics data from the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</a>, and produces roughly 25PB per year when the LHC is running.</p>
